# Governance

SpiderGraph is maintained as an open-source Grafana panel. Decisions are made in the open where practical, with maintainers responsible for project health, releases, security response, and compatibility commitments.

## Roles

- **Maintainers** review and merge changes, steward releases, and resolve project-level decisions.
- **Contributors** propose changes, improve documentation and tests, and participate in review.
- **Users** provide feedback, bug reports, examples, and validation across supported Grafana versions.

Maintainers may delegate release, documentation, or security responsibilities. Current ownership is listed in `CODEOWNERS`.

`@aviadshiber` is currently the sole repository owner and CODEOWNER. Only that account may merge
pull requests. Until an independent trusted reviewer is added, the project does not represent its
mandatory automated checks as human code review; the limitation and revisit trigger are documented
in [the security posture](docs/security-posture.md).

## Decision process

Routine changes are decided through pull-request review. Changes to the public data contract, compatibility tiers, governance, or security policy should be discussed in an issue or design-focused pull request before implementation. When consensus is not reached, maintainers make the final decision and document the rationale.

## Releases

A release should include tests, a changelog entry, compatibility notes, and a review of signing and catalog requirements. Release artifacts must not contain credentials or private data.
